# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

# 🚀 Overview

This is my first C programming project, built as part of my C programming practice. The game challenges the player to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. With each attempt, the game provides hints to guide the player toward the correct answer.

# 📌 Features

✅ 🔢 Generates a new random number on every execution

✅ 🎮 Simple and interactive console-based game

✅ 🔄 Uses do-while loop for continuous gameplay

✅ 🎯 Provides hints for guessing a higher or lower number

✅ 🏆 Displays the number of attempts taken to guess correctly

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

1. **C Programming**

2. **Standard Library Functions (stdlib.h, time.h)**

# 📜 Code Explanation

1. srand(time(NULL)); ensures that a new random number is generated each time the program runs.

2. rand() % 100 + 1; generates a number between 1 and 100.

3. The do-while loop ensures at least one attempt before checking the.

# 💡 Learnings

1. Basic Input/Output in C

2. Using rand() for random number generation

3. Looping and conditional logic

4. Working with time.h for seeding randomness
